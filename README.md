# Methodology
HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used for defining the 
structure of any website using series of tags and attributes to define layout and elements of the 
page. The HTML documents are rendered by web browser to display it’s content. Thus it is the 
backbone of all websites.
CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and is a language used for controlling the 
presentation of a website. The sole purpose of CSS is to make the website attractive and user 
friendly. It allows developers to separate the presentation of a web page from the structure 
making it easier to update and maintain.
Java Script: A website is fully completed when it is well functioning and interactive and 
this is done using Java Script. This programming language is used for adding interactivity and 
dynamic features to a website. It is a scripting language that runs on the client’s browser and 
allows to update the content of a webpage.
